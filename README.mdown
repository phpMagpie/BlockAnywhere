# Blockanywhere for Croogo CMS

Description of plugin

You can put blocks into the following:

* Layout
* Views
* Elements
* Blocks (with a change, see below)
* Blocks within blocks
* Node body and excerpt
* Any node field (if defined in BlockHelper::nodeFields)


## Usage

### Layout, view, element

    $this->Block->display('alias_of_block');


### Node body/excerpt

    [block:alias_of_block] or [b:alias_of_block]


## Blocks

Croogo has no callback when LayoutHelper::blocks() is called so to make sure
blocks are parsed replace the following in your layouts:

    echo $this->Layout->blocks('alias_of_block');

with...

    echo $this->Block->blocks('alias_of_block');
